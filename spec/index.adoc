vSEED_VERSION
:toc:

Seed is a general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of a discrete unit of work contained within a Docker
image.

To comply with the Seed standard a Docker image must have a single label used for discovery. This can be applied
with the following Dockerfile snippet:

----
include::examples/complete/Dockerfile-snippet[]
----

Seed compliant images must be named in a specific fashion due to the lack of label search capability on Docker Hub
and Registry services. The suffix `-seed` must be used when naming images to enable discovery, prior to Hub or Registry
push. This requirement will be deprecated as label search support is standardized across Docker registry services.

See the latest version of the link:detail.html[full specification] for complete detail on manifest format.
