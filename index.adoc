= JobPack

:toc:

JobPack is a general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of
discrete units of work contained within a Docker image.

To comply with the JobPack standard a Docker image must have at a minimum 2 labels:

----
LABEL com.jobpack.version="0.0.1"
LABEL com.jobpack.manifest="{...}"
----

JobPack compliant images must be named in a specific fashion due to the lack of label search capability on Docker Hub
and Registry services. The suffix `-jobpack` must be used when naming images to enable discovery, prior to Hub or Registry
push.
