JobPack is a general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of
discrete units of work contained within a Docker image.

To comply with the JobPack standard a Docker image must have a single label used for discovery. This can be applied
with the following Dockerfile snippet:

----
include::examples/complete/Dockerfile[]
----


JobPack compliant images must be named in a specific fashion due to the lack of label search capability on Docker Hub
and Registry services. The suffix `-jobpack` must be used when naming images to enable discovery, prior to Hub or Registry
push. This requirement will be deprecated as label search support is standardized across Docker registry services.
