The Containerized Job Definition Standard (CJDS) is a general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of
discrete units of work contained within a Docker image.

To comply with the CJDS a Docker image must have at a minimum 5 labels:

----
LABEL com.cjds.version="0.0.1"
LABEL com.cjds.name="watermark-image"
LABEL com.cjds.description="Job to add a watermark to an existing image"
LABEL com.cjds.system="Scale"
LABEL com.cjds.manifest="{...}"
----

CJDS compliant images must also be named in a specific fashion due to the lack of label search capability on Docker Hub
and Registry services. The suffix `-cjds` must be used when naming images to enable discovery, prior to Hub or Registry
push.

See the http://detail[full specification] for more detail.
